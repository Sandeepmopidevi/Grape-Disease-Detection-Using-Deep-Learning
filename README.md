# Grape-Disease-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project is a deep-learning-based image classification model for identifying grape diseases using transfer learning. It utilizes TensorFlow and Keras with multiple pre-trained architectures such as DenseNet121, Xception, NASNetLarge, and ResNet50 to classify grape leaves into four categories: Black Rot, ESCA, Healthy, and Leaf Blight.
